plan, 

1: read the assignment. 
2: scan trough the content of the file index.html/test.js/your_script_here.js
3: run the program, see what happens

4; repeat the first 2 steps again. Then decide about the step 5.

5: start making object. 
	what is a value and key in a object again? // a:20; a= key, 20 = value
	how to creat a object in a object? // solved

6: making function in part 2.
	see where the functions being called in the file, and what the function has to be 	proces or return values .... /maybe not yet. 
7 : 	functionTests	@	tests.js:117 // well lets declare all the function first. // declare 5 empty function  to see if the error goes away. 
8: 	the fill all the function with content. 
	function pickUpItem not working yet, let do the rest rest of the function first.
	// gevonden.... 
	bij eauipweapon= console.log (creature.inventory); = [{â€¦}]
		0
		:
		{type: "gun", damage: "100"}
		length
		:
		1
		__proto__
		:
		Array(0) ????? 

was expecting something like. inventory:['spoon', 'fork'],  
find out how to remove item from array by indexNr.

loopt vast. door naar de volgende functie

9: doBattle
	// write program according my own expectation of outcome, not working, 
	// let see the test.js first about the expected outcome. 
10: copy this to yourjavascript.js

var heroStub = { heroic: true, health: 10, weapon: { damage: 2 } }
 var creatureStub = { heroic: false, health: 5, weapon: { damage: 1 } }

then make the battle function till outcome heroicCreature.health ===8
	=unfunction the test.js.
	= put the value in your script to test. 
	= make test.js function again and test!
	
11: go back to solve the problem at the function equipweapon
	= dit doe ik nooit meer creature.inventory.splice[index, index+1]
